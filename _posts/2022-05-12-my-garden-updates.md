In [my last garden post](https://ntnhaatj.github.io/life/garden), all the plant and vegetable had dead due to my mistake. My own fertilizers from kitchen garbage decomposition progress has caused the soil was too hot for the root. Thus I decided to remake them.

...and today, after `22 days`, my garden has growed up

beside that, I also start making `vermicompost`, they ate kitchen garbage, it quite smelling but it good for soil and plant, here is the output after `15 days`

## Lessons
So many things I have learned from gardening, took a few months to see the growth of my garden, but it does practice my patient..

-----
```
everything needs progress, no matter how slowly
```
As long as we keep developing, fixing problems, everything will have the better output after all.

It does not matter how slowly you go, so long as you do not stop

-----
```
heathy plant requires a strong root system, human growth works in the same way
```
If we want to achieve sustainable development in a long term, build a solid base of knowledge
