Grow a small garden!

Today I woke up early as usual, dropped my wife off at the bus station for her work, back to the home ...and yeah... counting every day till the day our first little girl (4 months year-old in her mother's womb) say hello to the world...

My wife and I decided to name her `Nai` - which is pronounced the same as `Nice` or `Naive`, it means `Deer` in Vietnamese (so cute right? haha)

We can't wait to bring her up, take care of her, tell her our stories, and teach her all things we have...

That's why now I seriously focus on learning how to grow plants, I believe that gardening is a healthy and fun activity for children... She would be grateful the nature, how difficult it is to grow a plant/vegetable, moreover it helps to keep children stay away from games, smartphone :)

Hope she could enjoy harvesting the garden someday, be taught how to grow them, detect worms, get her hands dirty gardening (literally haha)... Those might be the very first lessons of her life ❤️

I have some progress pics to share:

**Artificial pollination**

Since my small garden is placed in the city, so it's hard to have bees or butterflies pollinated flowers.

I have to do it manually on my bitter melon and tomato
