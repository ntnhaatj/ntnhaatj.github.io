# Template Method Pattern

- `The Template Method` defines the steps of an algorithm and allows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps.

- Just a simple pattern:
    1) it is a method
    2) serves a template for an algorithm

- Can define `hook` function in algorithm to allow subclass or subclass's instance modify algorimth if any.

## Implementation
- [source code](https://github.com/ntnhaatj/head-first-design-patterns/tree/master/templatepattern)
