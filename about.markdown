Hi guys, welcome to my blog where I write things I have learned, also my life stories.

### Why am I decide to create this blog?
- where to store and track my knowledge, for what I have done (for many times, I forgot what I have done haha) as well as what I have learned from companions. It was written in my notes and stored on the GG drive, but now I want to publish them publicly so that anyone could read and discuss if they want.
- where to tell my life stories and keep all my emotions (hope that my kids would be able to read them in the future haha).
- where I could practice my bad English :v.
