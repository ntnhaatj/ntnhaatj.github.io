# The observe pattern

![Observer Pattern](/images/20220407/observer_pattern.png)

## Design principles
- Strive for loosely couple designs between objects that interact (allow us to build flexible OO system that can handle many changes because they minimize the interdependency between objects)

## Definition
- define a one-to-many dependency relationship so if the state of one object changed, it would notify to all of its depend objects

## Implementation
- [source code](https://github.com/ntnhaatj/head-first-design-patterns/tree/master/observerpatttern)
